## Introduction

The software available to Compute Canada users, including scientific and
research software, is maintained in a single central software stack accessible
from all Compute Canada clusters. This presents users with a consistent
experience across all current and future Compute Canada sites.

A variety of tools are used to achieve this. [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) and
[Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/) provide an underlying layer containing the
basic tools and commands usually provided by Linux operating systems.
[EasyBuild](https://github.com/hpcugent/easybuild) is used to build scientific
and research software, parallel and numerical libraries, and other
performance-critical software.
[Lmod](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/research-development/tacc-projects/lmod)
makes software packages available as modules that users can selectively add to
their environment. Custom [Python Wheels](http://pythonwheels.com/) provide
Python packages optimised for the Compute Canada software stack. Finally,
[CVMFS](https://cvmfs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) distributes the software stack,
making usable on all Compute Canada clusters and also publicly accessible.

## Initial setup

Before you can install software, you must [set up](setup.md) the Compute Canada
software stack repositories.

## Choosing an installation method

### Nix or EasyBuild?

The first step to install new software on the setup is to determine whether it
should be installed in Nix or with EasyBuild. Software in Nix is architecture-
and platform-independent. In general, we expect that most software installed in
Nix is software which would usually be provided by the OS. Nix also does not
integrate with modules. This means that if multiple versions are needed to be
swappable by users through modules, it has to be installed with EasyBuild.

The following guidelines should be followed, although exceptions may arise.

1. Is the software performance critical ?
   - Yes => [EasyBuild](easybuild.md)
2. Do you expect that multiple versions will be needed, swappable through
   modules?
   - Yes => [EasyBuild](easybuild.md), or EasyBuild wrapping Nix
   - No => [Nix](nix.md)

For examples, you can refer to [this
spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ySykcqUyVbJsNnDsWOdrxRZE0VseEQqNvW74Pf6iL00/edit#gid=0)
(staff CC link) where a lot of software has been identified as belonging to
either Nix or EasyBuild.

### Gentoo or EasyBuild?

The process for Gentoo is a little bit more strict than for Nix. As for Nix,
software in Gentoo is architecture- and platform-independent and software which
would usually be provided by the OS.

The following guidelines should be followed, although exceptions may arise.

1. Is the software performance critical ?
   - Yes => [EasyBuild](easybuild.md)
2. Do you expect that multiple versions will be needed, swappable through
   modules?
   - Yes => [EasyBuild](easybuild.md)
   - No => [Gentoo](gentoo.md) => please contact the RSNT team first

The current list of installed (via `emerge`) Gentoo packages is tracked in the
`world` file (`/cvmfs/soft.computecanada.ca/gentoo/2020/var/lib/portage/world`,
which is also copied
[here](https://github.com/ComputeCanada/gentoo-overlay/blob/main/etc/portage/world);
the complete list including dependencies can be obtained using `equery list
"*"`.

### Python packages

With very few exceptions, [installing Python packages](python.md) is done
through wheels rather than modules.

## Installing software

### With EasyBuild

See: [Installing with EasyBuild](easybuild.md)

### With Nix

See: [Installing with Nix](nix.md)

### With Gentoo

See: [Installing with Gentoo](gentoo.md)

### Python packages

See: [Installing Python packages](python.md)

## Deploying software

Centrally-installed software is made available by [deploying it with
CVMFS](cvmfs.md).

## Testing software

Several methods are available to [test software](testing.md) at various steps of
the installation process before it is made available to users.

## Examples
